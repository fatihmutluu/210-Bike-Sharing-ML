# Bike Rental Demand Prediction

The Bike Rental Demand Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the number of bike rentals based on various factors, including weather conditions and day properties. By analyzing data such as temperature, wind speed, holidays, weekdays, and seasons, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into bike rental demand patterns.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of bike rental data, weather conditions, and day properties to identify patterns and relationships.
- **Data Source:** Utilized datasets containing bike rental records and corresponding weather information to build the predictive model.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted and engineered relevant features from the data, such as temperature, wind speed, holidays, weekdays, and seasons, to capture their impact on bike rental demand.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Developed and trained machine learning models, such as regression or time series models, to predict the number of bike rentals based on the selected features.
- **Model Evaluation and Validation:** Employed appropriate evaluation metrics and validation techniques to assess the performance and accuracy of the predictive models.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilized data visualization techniques to present the relationships between bike rental demand and various factors, aiding in understanding and interpretation.
- **Deployment and Usage:** Provided guidelines and instructions for deploying and using the predictive model for estimating bike rental demand in real-world scenarios.
- **Documentation:** Documented the data analysis process, feature selection, model development, and evaluation to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
- **Collaboration:** Encouraged collaboration and contributions from others by making the project open-source and welcoming feedback and suggestions.
